  * Problem Statement 
  In this pandemic, people tend to spend their time at home by streaming movies through several platforms for their entertainment because they cannot go out. With this reason, movie production keeps increasing to meet the demand and the streaming industry is growing, providing movies from any country with foreign languages. 

  IMDB is the most popular movie website that combines movie descriptions alongside ratings, critics and user ratings and reviews. There is no doubt numerous movie titles for consumers to choose from, stemming from the multitude of streaming platforms containing a library of titles alongside new titles being produced.  Users spend an average of 3.24 minutes on the website and visit an average of 5.15 pages per visit. Users of IMDB rely on the website when it comes to making decisions on what movies to watch. We would like to identify what genre of movies is more interesting based on vote and rating data provided by IMDB dataset. The goal is to explore the dataset and to understand how users rate movies they’ve watched under distinct titles and genres leading to an analysis of what genre of movies are most interesting by votes/ratings.

  * Solutions
We will be finding a correlation between the provided movie attributes such as: 
  *                       average vote
  *                       rating
  *                       viewer/critic review
  *                       movie genre
  *                       language,  etc. 

Allowing the user to sort and filter the data by preferred attributes will enable them to generate a list of movies that fit their preferences. For example, if a user prefers movies that fall under the genre of “Romance” then the system can filter the movies from the data set that are labeled as romance movies, and then sort them from highest rating to lowest, based on viewer preference, for most accurate and satisfactory recommendation for the user.

  The type of analysis we will be providing will mainly involve filtering, aggregating, averaging, and providing a limited ranking based on certain elements. Due to the growing accessibility of movie libraries from streaming services, we are faced with an ever growing number of choices, but we do not have the time to explore each one. We can establish a starting point for every movie watcher (casual or connoisseur). We will analyze to see if certain countries specialize in making certain genres of movies, based on reviewer score. In addition we will analyze the shifting trends of genres by country and over the course of time This would lead us into identifying “Golden Ages” of a certain movie genres. These outputs will help a user pinpoint which movies are the perfect match.
