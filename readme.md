# Program Description

In this pandemic, people tend to spend more time than usual at home by streaming movies through multiple platforms for their entertainment since they cannot go out. With movie productions increasing and the streaming industry growing, the amount of movies available to a user is staggering. Our goal here is to demistify the many movies available amongst different lanuages, countries, and genres.

To ease the process of searching for a good mov
ie, our program will display top movie choices (by average user rating) based on Genre selected while displaying key attributes that the user may be interested in. The user will have the chance to also filter by their preferred time period (2 decades increments) in order to further filter the data set to ensure that they get results of movies that they would care about. As we've seen movies of different Genres vary in quality greatly over the years, (Ex: The older a thriller movie is, the better received it was, whereas Animation movies have been evenly received well.)

Towards the end, we also present correlationary info between various attributes (viewer/critic review, movie genre, and language.) against average user rating in order to see if there are any factors that predict that a movie will be good.


# Instructions: Starting the Program

Step 1
In order the user to use the program itself, the IMDB movies dataset will have to be downloaded from Kaggle as a csv file named "movies". When downloading the movies csv, please ensure that all of the columns have been selected, as kaggle displays only the first 10 by default.

Step 2
Please Save the Project Code from the following link to the same folder as the IMDB movies dataset as a .py file: https://github.com/yancyv1220/CIS-9650-Group-9-Project/blob/main/Project%20Code


# Instructions: User inputs

Step 3
Once code is running, the user is prompted for their preferred movie Genre, which a list of available Genres are provided to the user just above the prompt.

The user will also have to make their choice of time period segment they want results from in which the number associated to the choice is provided just above.

In addition to the User specific inputs, there are also required inputs throughout the program that are meant to give the user time to read the results. The input given by the user here do not actually change the results that are being shown.
